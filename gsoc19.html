          <p>
            Every year more than 100 students apply for GSoC under the umbrella
            organization PSF. Currently there is a multi-user blogging website
            using WordPress CMS hosted for the students to publish their weekly
            blogs and a static landing page for reaching out to people for more
            information about this program. This project aims to build a
            platform which allows smooth management of the GSoC program at PSF
            every year and also ties everyone associated with it to PSF, so that
            their work or they themselves can help out others in future.

        <h2 id="Summer-Rewind">Summer Rewind</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s rewind to the beginning of this year. We had started working on
          this application way before GSoC had even started. The goal was to
          have a working application which PSF will be able to use for this
          year’s GSoC for the management of their students. In this way, we will
          be able to make sure that students actually use it and we get a clear
          idea if the application is serving its purpose. I’m glad the plan
          worked out, because tons of bugs were reported and we could fix them.
          We also received valuable feedback from all users.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Schedulers-and-Builders">Schedulers and Builders</h3>
        <p>
          Allow me to introduce you to some of the most important modules of our
          system. Without any doubt the first on the list is our
          <code>Scheduler</code>, which can perform particular tasks from
          sending an email to archiving webpages. Well, the most powerful
          feature of this module is that it can perform those tasks at any
          particular date and time. Need to remind students that they have not
          written a blog on time? Not a big deal, <code>Scheduler</code> can do
          that for you. Now think of this, many students who are not like me
          publish their blogs on time, so we don’t really need to spam them with
          emails. Thus we built the module <code>Builder</code> which in turn
          builds <code>Scheduler</code> on different conditions.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Blogging-Platform">Blogging Platform</h3>
        <p>
          We didn’t have to create a blogging platform as we integrated
          <a
            href="https://github.com/divio/aldryn-newsblog"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><code>aldryn-newsblog</code></a
          >
          but we had to tweak it a lot to fit into our system. Something that we
          had to work on was setting up custom permissions for each user so that
          they only have access to their blogs. We achieved this with the help
          of django admin which allows us to set add, view, change permissions
          based on querysets! Sanitizing the artilce contents was another
          challenge that we faced because aldryn-newsblog uses an editor which
          injects <code>HTML</code> so that users can customize their blog
          posts. Our system currently allows only particular tags like
          <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, etc. Other tags are
          sanitized conditionally, like for iframes we only render iframes for
          YouTube videos so that users can add YouTube videos to their articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also tweaked the article list templates to include our own
          reddit-styled comment system which makes use of recursion on django
          templates to display different threads. For more information on how to
          achieve this, check out the article
          <a

        <h3 id="Tweaking-Django">Tweaking Django</h3>
        <p>
          We used <code>django-forms</code> wherever we could, but there were
          cases where we needed to customize the forms to an extent which wasn’t
          supported out of the box. We have a form which lets suborg admins and
          admins add selected students to the system. Generally, this includes
          adding a lot of students (~50). Typing out the emails one by one is
          still okay, but selecting the GSoC year or the Suborg one by one for
          each student? Ask my mentor, and he will let you know what a pain it
          is. So, we tweaked the django form to add buttons which would let the
          admin select a particular Suborg, year for all the mentioned users.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://i.imgur.com/WUEPwDG.gif"
            alt="set-default-fields-gsoc19.gif"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          We have RSS feeds for each blog separately (all the articles published
          by a student) and also for all the articles published on this
          platform. Django has
          <a
            href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/syndication/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Syndication Feed Framework</a
          >
          which allows customizable RSS feeds, but the all articles feed was too
          long and took seconds to load. We needed to paginate the feed, and we
          were out of luck as django didn’t support this out of the box. This
          was a challenge, as we had to take in the request object and parse the
          url to get the page number and render the blogs accordingly. We also
          added the year argument which takes in the year and displays the blogs
          of that particular GSoC. The current feed url looks something like
          this
          <a
            href="https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/feed/?y=2019&amp;p=2"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/feed/?y=2019&amp;p=2</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most of the other admin features, we heavily relied upon django
          admin. The admin portal lets admins
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add new <code>Scheduler</code>s and <code>Builder</code>s</li>
          <li>
            Check blog post histories of different articles to track changes
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the current GSoC timeline which gets pushed to the schedule page
            in the github site repository
          </li>
          <li>Send custom emails to users as admins</li>
          <li>Review comments and delete them if necessary</li>
          <li>Disable a user profile if the student fails mid-way</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="Integration-with-Github">Integration with Github</h3>
        <p>
          We annotated some of the manual work that an admin has to put in to
          maintain the static site on Github. Our system creates pull requests
          adding new Suborgs in the Ideas page whenever a new Suborg Application
          is added, it also archives current pages when the GSoC program ends.
          These pulls can then be reviewed and merged to master by the admin.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Fixing-Bugs">Fixing Bugs</h3>
        <p>
          This was really a major part of the whole summer and it went hand in
          hand with the whole developmene process. There were bugs that were
          found by the users, and the others figured out by the mentors and me.
          There are a ton of “Bugfix” PRs which were basically bug fixes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a time when we pushed some changes and it made the system
          send emails to all the users regardless of whether they have blogged
          or not. Yes, basically we spammed a lot of users unintentionally. This
          was another challenge that we had faced and overcame eventually by
          making a flag which would disable all notifications to any user. We
          also followed a strict push cycle to avoid any disturbance to students
          blogging at the end of the week.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Wrapping-Up">Wrapping Up</h3>
        <p>
          We ran accessibility tests on our websites and fixed issues which
          decrease the accessibility of the website, like fixing contrast ratios
          of texts and background, adding alts to images, etc. We also worked on
          boosting the loading speed of out website on mobiles. In built tools
          provided by Chrome and Firefox gave us a list of issues after
          analyzing the website which we could work on.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also ended up using a cache server to cache the data to fasten up
          the whole loading process. We also needed to manually override caching
          in some pages like the comments page, which would not show the new
          comment as the old one was cached. This is the
          <a

        <h2 id="Future-Plans">Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, the platform provides most of the functionality required
          for a smooth GSoC run at PSF, but there are features that would make
          it even smoother for the admins and make their lives a bit less
          painful. One of them is adding the mentors to the
          <a
            href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >GSoC site</a
          >
          automatically from the system’s database. This can be another nasty
          manual work (typing in the emails, names, etc. one by one) and needs
          to be done automatically. For more details, check this
          <a
            href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-blogs/issues/287"

            rel="noopener"
            >issue</a
          >
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also need to write unit and integration tests for features that are
          not provided by django or any third-party packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would love to work on these in future even when this GSoC ends, fix
          more bugs as and when they come up and be a part of this great
          community!

        <p>
          First of all, any of this would not have been possible without my
          mentors and other members of the PSF community. So a huge shout-out to
          them for helping me whenever I needed and for guiding me when I was
          clueless on how to proceed. While I was busy coding, my mentor would
          look for potential bugs in the system and point them out to me. This
          really kept me busy throughout the summer as I always had bugs to fix,
          and helped me make the system more stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I would thank Google for organising such an amazing program for
          students who are passionate about coding and giving them an
          opportunity to gain some hands-on experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not the least, I would thank my fellow applicants who also
          worked on building the application with me to bring it to a stage
          where it could be used in this year’s GSoC run.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2 id="Apologies">Apologies</h2>
        <p>
          There are a lot of mistakes that I made and learnt from them. In the
          beginning I was not testing stuff through before making a PR,
          sometimes trying to do things faster and the other times just being
          lazy. It only made me spend more time on a particular feature as there
          were things that would not work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing that I should apologize for is being very irregular
          about posting blogs. This shouldn’t have come from me, as I was the
          student working on the very blogging platform itself.
